<h1> About me </h1>

<p> Hi! My name is Agnieszka. I'm learning programming, because some day I'd like to be a frontend deweloper. I was studing civil engineering, and now I'm working in 
construction company. After few years of working there I realized that it is not what I would like to do in my life. 
Now, I draw a lot of fun getting programming skills, and I believe this is what would suites me more and It would be not only a job but also a hobby!
So... please, keep your finger crossed for successful job change! </p>
